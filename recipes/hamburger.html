    <p>Your trusty air fryer is the key to these perfect potato wedges: They're crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and absolutely irresistible. This top-rated recipe for air-fried potato wedges is one you'll come back to again and again. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon beef base (such as Better than BouillonÂ®)</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Form beef into 4 patties, approximately 3/4 inches thick and 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Make the patties slightly bigger than the buns to allow for shrinkage.</li>
        <li>Whisk together warm melted butter and beef soup base in a small bowl. Brush lightly onto both sides of patties and season with pepper. Set patties into the air fryer basket. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook them in batches.</li>
        <li>Air-fry patties for 7 minutes, flipping halfway through, for medium doneness. For well done, air-fry for an additional 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
